[code][h1]Overview[/h1]
[list][h2]This mod allows you to quickly create road markings at intersections.[/h2][/list]
[/code]

[*] This is for detailing and aesthetics [b][i] ONLY [/i][/b] and [b][i] WILL NOT [/i][/b] tell your traffic where to go. If you want to control traffic, please see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1637663252]Traffic Manager: President Edition[/url].

[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2040656402]Harmony 2.0[/url] is required for the mod to work.

[*] You can move and adjust the intersection with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619685021]Move It![/url] and will not need to redraw your lines.  They automatically redraw themselves.

[*] There is no impact to Game Limits since the markings are not considered objects by the game.

[*] There is little to no performance impact which can vary based on each user's system.

[*] This tool can be disabled or unsubscribed at any time without breaking save games.

[h1]Support[/h1]
If you have any problems with mod or errors occur, you should describe your problem as much detailed as possible, comments like “mod does not work” will be ignored.
Also, you should provide the game log, comments about errors without game log will be ignored too. Read [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463645931]here[/url] how to share log. 

Although, the best way to solve problems is joining to my discord and write to [b]#Support[/b] channel, unfortunately, steam comments is very useless for conversation.
